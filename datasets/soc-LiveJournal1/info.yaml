  description: LiveJournal is a free on-line community with almost 10 million members; a significant fraction of these members are highly active. (For example, roughly 300,000 update their content in any given 24-hour period.) LiveJournal allows members to maintain journals, individual and group blogs, and it allows people to declare which other members are their friends they belong.
